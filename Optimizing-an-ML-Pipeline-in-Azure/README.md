# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The projects is performed on the Bank Marketing Dataset and the Azure ML Studio, In which we aims at making a binary prediction to find whether customers will join a Bank or Not.This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking sector. The campaigns were based on phone calls.

The best performing model was a **Voting Ensemble**. This was found using Automl feature of Azure.

### Files Used to perform the Analysis are 

- Train.py
- Project.ipynb

We need to build a Machine learning model using skikit learn and tune the hyper parameters to find the best model using azure ML python SDK and Hyper Drive.
Post that we need to use the Azure AutoML Feature to find the best model and best Hyperparameters.At the end of this project, we want to create a solid understanding about the Azure ML Studio and some important standard practices of MLops inside Azure platform.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
